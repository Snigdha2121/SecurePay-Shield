# Machine Learning Directory

## Overview
This directory contains all the code for building and training machine learning models used in the **SecurePay Shield** application. The models are designed to predict potential fraudulent activities related to UPI transactions and credit card/online banking. Both models leverage the **Random Forest** algorithm to ensure high accuracy and robust fraud detection.

## Contents
